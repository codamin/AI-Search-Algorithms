    "## Project Abstract\n",
    " In this project we want to implement different uninformed and informed search strategies and test their functionality on the snake game. The game has a snake starting from a starting point of a rectangular grid map. At first snake has length one. Some cells of the map has some number of foods. Snake can move in one of 4 directions and when reaching a cell containing food, it eats one of the foods on that cell and become 1 unit longer. If the snake eats a food, it's tail will remain in the previous cell otherwise it's tail will go forward one cell. The goal is to find the minimum number of moves snake must take to eat all the foods. We will model this game as a search problem and solve it."

    "### Search Algorithms\n",
    "Generally all the algorithms start from expanding the initial state and then use a specific data structure to store the new states. We will use `Graph Search` which means we will not expand the nodes which are expanded before and we will not also put a state which is in the fringe, in it. For this purpose we use the `set` data structure to store the states which are expanded before and with O(1) cost we could check the existence of state in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uninformed(Blind) Search:\n",
    "In this kind of searched we do not have any information about the goal state. So we must search through all space states to find the goal so this may have high cost.\n",
    "\n",
    " - ### BFS(Breadth First Search):\n",
    "    This algorithm expands each state in search space in a FIFO manner, i.e. it pushes each new state in a queue and each time that it wants to expand a state, expands the first state in the queue. Each newly seen state is pushed in the fringe if it is not their yet and if it is not explored before(it is not in the exlored set).\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### Pros:\n",
    "    - It is complete: so it will eventually find the goal state.\n",
    "    - It is optimal: so it will find the goal state in the minimum cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### Cons:\n",
    "    - It's memory usage grows exponentially with the increase of depth because it stores last tiers whole states in the fringe.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ### IDS(Iterative Deepening Search):\n",
    "    Depth first search algorithm, expands states with more distance(depth) from initial states, sooner so it searches in a LIFO manner, i.e. it pushes each new state in a stack because when popping stack, it returns the last item inserted to it. Each newly seen state is pushed in the fringe if it is not their yet and if it is not explored before(it is not in the exlored set).\n",
    "    DFS algorithm is lenear space but it's downsides are that it is not complete in infinite spaces and it is not optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Iterative DFS search uses depth search algorithm iteratively with increasing maximum depth from zero to MAX_DEPTH. It is a mixture of BFS and DFS and so it has the positive points of BFS and DFS. It is complete, optimal and linear in space but it is not so much fast.\n",
    "\n",

    "    - It is not very fast\n",

    "### Informed Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In these kind of searches, for each state we have estimate cost of reaching the goal starting from that state. The function that assign this estimate cost for each state is called `Heuristic Function` or `h(n)`. Having this information, we can first search the states which have less estimated cost and probably it will help reaching the goal with expanding less states. If we only compare the states based on the `h(n)` we say that our `evaluation function(f(n))` is equal to h(n) and it may end in an optimal path to goal(this strategy is called `Greedy Best First Algorithm`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A* Search:\n",
    "    This algorithm is a best first search algorithm and is a combination of `Uniform Cost Search`(this strategy expands the lowest cost states first using a `Priority Queue` fringe so f(n) = g(n)) and greedy best first search. In this strategy we have \\\\(f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\\\\). This algorith uses priority queue as it's fringe data structure and each time it expands the state having minimum f(n). g(n) is the cost of reaching state n from initial state and h(n) is the estimated cost of reaching the goal from state n. Thus expanding the state having least f(n) will pick the nodes which are probably(it depends on that how much good is the heuristic function) on the least cost(optimal) paths from starting state through the goal state.\n",
